This project applies deep learning techniques to predict the likelihood of diabetes in individuals based on healthcare-related parameters. Using a feedforward neural network, the model processes clinical data such as age, BMI, blood glucose levels, and lifestyle indicators to make accurate binary predictions (diabetic or non-diabetic)
